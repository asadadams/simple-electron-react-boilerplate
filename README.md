# Simple Electron + React Boilerplate
I made this boilerplate because i found it very diffcult to setup an Electron project with React when i first wanted to this. I also didn't like the way most boilerplates were set up. This is a really simple and minimal Electron + React boilerplate to get you started with a project. This project use a Webpack as a module bundler to React ES2015 to vanilla JS. HAPPY CODING!!!

## Overview
All components are located in src folder.

## To get started
  * Make sure you have node installed 
  * Clone or download repository
      ```
            git clone https://github.com/asadadams/simple-electron-react-boilerplate.git
      ```
  * Copy the contents of node_modules into a different directory
  * Install packages
      ```
        npm install    
      ```
      
## Usage
To start development 

* Run webpack 
      ```
            npm run dev
      ```

* Start project
      ```
            npm start
      ``` 

## Developers
If you are a developer feel free to contribute to the project by providing bug fixes, new ideas and suggestions.  
*NB: This was also written out of boredom and i needed a boilerplate to start with whenever i'm starting a new project.*
