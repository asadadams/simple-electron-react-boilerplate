# Simple Electron + React Boilerplate
I made this boilerplate because i found it very diffcult to setup an Electron project with React when i first wanted to this. I also didn't like the way most boilerplates were set up. This is a really simple and minimal Electron + React boilerplate to get you started with a project. This project use a Webpack as a module bundler to React ES2015 to vanilla JS. ENJOY CODING!!!

## Overview
All components are located in src folder.

## To get started
  * Make sure you have node installed 
  * Make sure you have electron installed globally with npm
      ```
            npm install electron -g
      ```
  * Clone or download repository
      ```
            git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/asadadams/simple-electron-react-boilerplate
      ```
  * And then install dependencies with npm 
      ```
            $ cd your-project-name
            $ npm install
      ```
      
## Usage
To start development 

* Run webpack 
      ```
            npm run dev
      ```

* Start project
      ```
            npm start
      ```

*NB: This was also written out of boredom and i needed a boilerplate to start with whenever i'm starting a new project, :laughing: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: (needed something to do).*
